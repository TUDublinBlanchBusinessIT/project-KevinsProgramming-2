# Mobile Application CA Brief - Individual Project

You are required to build a Mobile App in React Native. 
You can do something different from the idea you had in CA 1 but in this instance you need to do a new App Statement(not wireframes or process flows) to accompany your submission.

# Minimum Requirements: 

1. Save data to Firebase
2. Retrieve data from Firebase

# Project Requirements Summary

**App Purpose:** Create an app that gathers user input, processes it, and provides results. It can be a proof of concept with limited functionality but should clearly showcase the app's intended purpose and operation.

**Techniques:** Use skills learned during the semester, incorporating additional features from independent research for higher marks.

**UX:** Ensure a positive user experience with a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly interface.

**AI Use:**
1. Utilize generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, or CodeWhisperer.

2. Keep a log of AI prompts/responses with timestamps.

3. Write a Â½-page reflection on AI use, including tools, usefulness, limitations, impact on learning, and how AI enhanced app functionality.

# Server Side Web Development CA Brief - Individual Project

This project requires me to design and implement a web-based application which records and updates information stored in a MySQL Database.

# Minimum Requirements: 

1. Take information from the screen and insert it into a DB using the “Insert Into” command.
2. Select Info from a DB and display it to the screen.

# Ideas

1. Multiple database tables. The first and second versions (insert into and select from) should just include one table. As you expand on your system you could introduce a second table. If you have a second table be sure to consider whether you need a primary key - foreign key relationship between your tables. (Your system could still score very well even with one table so its not absolutely necessary
2. Login. Allowing users to login. Storing a username and password in the db and validating against these. Preventing access to certain pages unless the user is logged in.
3. Drop down lists populated from database tables.
4. Rich forms. i.e. use of a broad range of input controls - checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-downs, slider control etc.
5. Sessions - Timing out a user who has not accessed the page in more than 10 minutes (or however long)
6. Calculation based on a DateTime object. You could calculate a persons age given their date of birth or calculate the number of days between two dates.
